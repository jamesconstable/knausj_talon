## Talon is an awesome project that will allow you to use voice dication, Tobii eye tracker, and even write code. This is a tipsheet to get started with the beta (paid) version. These instructions do not apply to the free version!  

First, sign up for the beta ($15 USD) at https://www.patreon.com/join/lunixbochs (create a patreon account if you don't already have one)  

Next, join the Slack workspace talonvoice.slack.com. Then, send a direct message to @aegis to let him know you've signed up for the beta program. He'll add you to the beta channel.  

Check the pinned messages for the latest download for your OS (mac, linux, windows). For mac, download the dmg file and install it. You'll now have a new directory called .talon (hidden) in your user's home directory. 

You will need a copy of the https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon repo. Git clone (or just download and unzip) into your user directory. So now you'll have users/username/.talon/user folder and the knausj_talon within it (there will be subfolders like apps, code, lang, misc, etc).  

Next, again in the pinned files of the beta channel, find the instructions and URL to download Wav2letter and extract it into .talon if done correctly, the folder structure should have these additional files:  

~/.talon/w2l/en_US  
~/.talon/user/w2l.py
